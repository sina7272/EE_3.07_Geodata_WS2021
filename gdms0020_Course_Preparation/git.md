# We use Git!

## What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system for source code management. It provides a set of commands to interact with a local repository as well as a remote repository (server). **GitHub** and **GitLab** are two server implementations for Git often used as source-code-hosting facilities.


## Install a Git Client 

The are many different [Git clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The clients can be used to interact with both GitLab and GitHub. The purists use the command line interface (CLI). 

For now we recommend the graphical user interface [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/). 

## Clone the Repository

Command line: `git clone https://github.com/rolfbecker/EE_3.07_Geodata_WS2021.git`

With **GitHub Desktop**:

1. Open GitHub desktop
1. Go to _File -> Clone repository ..._
1. Change to tab _URL_
1. Copy the URL `https://github.com/rolfbecker/EE_3.07_Geodata_WS2021.git` into the URL field
1. Choose your local path (directory). In this directory a new directory with the repo name will be created.
1. Press button _clone_.
